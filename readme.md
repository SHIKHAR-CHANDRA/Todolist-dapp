## Todo List Dapp :-

This is a Todo list that is powered by  ethereum smart contract, In which we'll be creating
a smart contract using solidity programming language and then we will write tests against 
the smart contract and deploy it to the block chain,and deploy it to a blockchain.And at 
last we will be creating a client side for the application.


To access the blockchain todo list, we'll use a web browser to talk to the client side application,
which will be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of talking to a back end web server
,the client side application will talk directly to the blockchain. source: dapp university.
